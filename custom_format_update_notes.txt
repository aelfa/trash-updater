basic quality profile and custom format update steps:

## Custom Format Updates

1. Pull down all existing custom formats
2. Search all of them for a specification named "trash_id" and has an ID that matches JSON from the guide
3. For matches: Update it using the CF data from the guide
4. For CFs in the guide that do not exist in Radarr:
	a. Build a request object initially using data from the guide JSON
	b. Add a new `specification` (condition) that:
		1. has 1 new `field` in it with `value` set to `trash_<TRASHID>`, where TRASHID comes from the guide
		2. specification `name` set to `"trash_id"`
		3. specification `negate` set to `true` (so it doesn't interfere with searches)
	c. Step b only happens when creating whole new CFs
5. For CFs in Radarr with `trash_id` that do not exist in the guide:
	a. Delete them from Radarr

## Quality Profile Updates

1. Pull down all quality profiles
2. Filter out profiles that are not specified in the YAML config
3. If a quality profile mentioned in user config does not exist in Radarr, show an error in logs and continue
4. For each quality profile, set all the scores for CFs specified in YAML config. Score priority:
	a. Score in YAML first, if not specified:
	b. Score from the guide, if not present:
	c. Assign a score of 0 and issue a warning in logs

Notes:
- Custom format scores are in the `formatItems` field
